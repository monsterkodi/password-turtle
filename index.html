<h2><a name="what_it_does">What it does</a></h2>
<p>
It generates a unique password from 3 ingredients:
<ul>
    <li>a master key
    <li>a pattern 
    <li>a site name
</ul>        
<p>
It stores your pattern(s) and site names for you<br> 
in an encrypted file on your hard drive.
<p>            
It makes it easy to have a different passsword for each site<br>
while only needing to remember a single master password.

<h2><a name="how_to_use_it">How to use it</a></h2>
<p>
When you start the application,<br> 
a turtle icon will be added to your menu bar:
<p>
    <img src="img/menubar.png" />
<p>
Clicking the menu icon will open a window and prompt you to<br>
enter your master key:
<p> 
    <img src="img/welcome.png" />
<p>
... and a default pattern:
<p>
    <img src="img/pattern.png" />
<p>
    
<h3>Tips for choosing a pattern</h3>
The length of the pattern determines<br>
the length of the generated passwords. 
<p>
The kind of characters you use in the pattern<br>
is reflected in the password.
<p>
If you use a pattern with some reasonable length<br>
and include some special characters and digits in it,<br> 
you can probably use it on most of the sites out there.
<p>    
From now on, if you enter a site name<br>
the turtle will generate a unique password for it:
<p>
    <img src="img/site.png" />
<p>
    
<h2><a name="caveats">Caveats</a></h2>

If you forget your master password, you won't be able<br>
to decrypt your stash file and regenerate your passwords.

<p>
If you loose your stash file your default pattern<br> 
and site names will be lost.
<p>
    
Therefore: don't forget your master password<br> 
and regularly backup your stash file, which is located at<br>
<pre>~/Library/Preferences/password-turtle.stash</pre>
